# Computer-Visio-Project
My project in Computer Vision and CNN.

In this project, I built a CNN model with pytorch, which is able
to classify 2 citrus diseases.
The model, in its core, uses a ResNet-50 model with pre-trained weights.
My goal in this project was to apply some augmentation technics to the dataset,
in order to optimize to training process.
